## Data Analyst 🤓🧮🧐

Hi there! I'm Kema 👋

I'm a data enthusiast with a knack for making numbers tell their story. I love diving into data to find insights that boost productivity and streamline workflows. I’m skilled in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Dune Analytics, Flipside, Tableau.

✨ My mission: Turn data into actionable insights that drive meaningful change and empower decision-making.

🚀 I’m always up for learning the latest tools and tech (and a fun challenge or two)!

🌱 Currently exploring new opportunities where I can contribute to a passionate team and keep growing my analytics skills.

When I'm not crunching data, you might find me salsa dancing, geeking out over sci-fi, or trying out new recipes. Looking forward to connecting and seeing where data can take us!
